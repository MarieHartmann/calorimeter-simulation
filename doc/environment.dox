* @section environment_git GIT / GitLab
*
* Your computer project will be managed using git.
*
* @subsection environment_git_repo Git repository
*
* The original project should be cloned to your local computer:
* ```
git clone https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/npac/calorimeter-simulation.git
* ```
* This repository must be redefined as the `upstream` project:
* ```
cd calorimeter-simulation/
git remote rename origin upstream
* ```
* Go to [gitlab](https://gitlab.lal.in2p3.fr) and create a new project named `calorimeter-simulation`.
* @note PLEASE, invite Florent Robinet as a member of your project: got to "members" and add Florent Robinet as a "developer"
*
* Add this `origin` remote to your local repository:
* ```
git remote add origin git@gitlab.lal.in2p3.fr:robinet/calorimeter-simulation.git
* ```
* @note Change `robinet` by your username. This assumes that a ssh key is in place.
*
* Now you should see 2 remote repositories:
* ```
git remote -v
origin	git@gitlab.lal.in2p3.fr:robinet/calorimeter-simulation.git (fetch)
origin	git@gitlab.lal.in2p3.fr:robinet/calorimeter-simulation.git (push)
upstream	https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/npac/calorimeter-simulation.git (fetch)
upstream	https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/npac/calorimeter-simulation.git (push)
* ```
* Then push the changes to your remote repo using:
* ```
git push origin master
git pull upstream master && git push origin master
* ```
* Now, your project is in place in gitlab. You can check it at https://gitlab.lal.in2p3.fr/robinet/calorimeter-simulation
*
* @subsection environment_git_worflow Git workflow
*
* @subsubsection environment_git_worflow_commit Commit your changes
*
* When you develop your code, you should frequently commit and push your changes to your remote repository:
* ```
# commit your changes to your local repository:
git commit -a

# push your changes to your origin repository:
git push origin
* ```
* Your remote repository will be used to control and evaluate your work.
* 
* @subsubsection environment_git_worflow_add Add new files
*
* If you want to add a new file to your repository:
* ```
git add [new file]
git commit [new file]
* ```
*
* @subsubsection environment_git_worflow_upstream Synchronize with upstream
*
* When a the original repository is updated (by F. Robinet), you may want to update your repository to synchronize the changes:
* ```
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master origin/master
git push
* ```
*
* @section environment_conda Conda environment 
*
* For this project, it is assumed that the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) environment is installed on your machine.
* You can also refer to the [NPAC computing course](https://ens.lal.in2p3.fr/NPAC/env_initialisation.html#execution-environment).
